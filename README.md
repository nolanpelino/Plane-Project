# Plane-Project
## Project Description
This repo contains a project from my software engineering class. The requirements for this project were to built a flight booking serivce similar to competetiors like Expedia or Trivago. This project contains a user authentication system which reads and writes to json files. The user can also enter their preferences and can select flights from a retrieved json file.

## Challenges Faced
Orignally, this project was designed for 4 members to a group. Quickly, two of my group members stopped communicating and dropped out of the class. Later on, me and the remaining group memeber were assigned two substitutes. However, they committed minimal code and failed to follow direction from the professor. Given the bad cards we were dealt, my partner and I were able to completely reorganize our plan and structure of the project. This provided a challange as we both spent hours of our own communicating with Professor Plante and ensuring that we completed the required functions of the project.
